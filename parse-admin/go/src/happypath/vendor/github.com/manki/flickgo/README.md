This is a client library written in Google's [Go language](https://golang.org/)
for interacting with [Flickr's REST API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
Primary development focus is to be compatible with [Google App
Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/)'s server environment.

    go get github.com/manki/flickgo

Library has support for only a few API calls. If you need to use a call that's
not yet implemented, adding it should be trivial. [Email
me](mailto:manki@manki.in) for support.
